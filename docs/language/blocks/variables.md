# Variables Blocks

Variables in goboscript are declared using `var` for global variables and `local` for local variables within procedures and functions. Lists are declared using the `list` keyword.

See the [Variables](../variables.md) and [Lists](../lists.md) sections for more information on variable and list usage in goboscript.
